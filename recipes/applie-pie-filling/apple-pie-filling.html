    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Peel and core the fruit, cut it into slices, then macerate 
            them in a plume of sugar. Cook these soft with a splash of 
            acid (like lemon juice or cider vinegar) and a hint of 
            cinnamon and allspice, then add some starch to thicken the 
            whole. Allow the mixture to cool completely before using 
            it in the pie.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 8 servings</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2½ pounds apples, peeled and cored, then cut into wedges
                (5 large honeycrisps will do it)</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>½teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>¾cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 recipe <a href="../pie-crust/pie-crust.html">pie crust</a> </li>
            <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a large saute pan set over medium-high 
                heat and add apples to the pan. Stir to coat fruit 
                with butter and cook, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, 
                whisk together the spices, salt and ¾ cup sugar, and 
                sprinkle this over the pan, stirring to combine. Lower 
                heat and cook until apples have started to soften, 
                approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle the flour and 
                cornstarch over the apples and continue to cook, stirring 
                occasionally, another 3 to 5 minutes. Remove pan from 
                heat, add cider vinegar, stir and scrape fruit mixture 
                into a bowl and allow to cool completely. (The fruit 
                mixture will cool faster if spread out on a rimmed 
                baking sheet.)</li>
            <li>Place a large baking sheet on the middle rack of oven 
                and preheat to 425. Remove one disc of dough from the 
                refrigerator and, using a pin, roll it out on a lightly 
                floured surface until it is roughly 12 inches in diameter. 
                Fit this crust into a 9-inch pie plate, trimming it to 
                leave a .5-inch overhang. Place this plate, with the dough, 
                in the freezer.</li>
            <li>Roll out the remaining dough on a lightly floured surface 
                until it is roughly 10 or 11 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Remove pie crust from freezer and put the cooled pie filling 
                into it. Cover with remaining dough. Press the edges together, 
                trim the excess, then crimp the edges with the tines of a fork. 
                Using a sharp knife, cut three or four steam vents in the top 
                of the crust. Lightly brush the top of the pie with egg wash 
                and sprinkle with remaining tablespoon of sugar.</li>
            <li>Place pie in oven and bake on hot baking sheet for 20 minutes, 
                then reduce temperature to 375. Continue to cook until the 
                interior is bubbling and the crust is golden brown, about 30 
                to 40 minutes more. Remove and allow to cool on a windowsill 
                or kitchen rack, about two hours.</li>
