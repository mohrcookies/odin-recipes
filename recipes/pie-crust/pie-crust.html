    <h1>Pie Crust</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>No need for the food processor or tough pie crusts anymore—I've 
            found the perfect pastry dough. It's flaky, buttery, and easy
            to make, with no special equipment needed—just your hands 
            and a large bowl. The secret? Sour cream. Instead of adding 
            water, you use sour cream. It really works and is super simple.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 2 pie crusts</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 sticks unsalted butter (1 cup, 8oz, 225g) cubed</li>
            <li>2 cups (280g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar (for sweet recipes, otherwise skip)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt (skip if using salted butter)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (115ml) sour cream (full fat, NOT light sour cream)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <h3>Cut the butter into cubes and let sit:</h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cut the butter into cubes and let it sit on the
                    counter to take the chill off (don't soften the
                    butter, just let it sit out for a <strong>couple minutes</strong>
                    when you take it out of the fridge).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <h3>Whisk together the dry ingredients:</h3>
                </p>
                <p>In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, 
                    sugar (if using), and salt (omit if using salted butter).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <h3>Work the butter into the flour:</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Sprinkled the cubes of butter over the flour. Use your 
                    clean hands to squish the flour and butter together 
                    with your thumbs, fingers, and knuckles. Work the 
                    butter into the dough until you have what resembles 
                    a coarse meal with some flattened chunks of butter.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <h3>Add the sour cream:</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Add the sour cream to the flour and butter mixture. 
                    Use a fork to incorporate into the mixture.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <h3>Form the dough into disks, refrigerate:</h3>
                </p>
                <p>Use your hands to gather the pastry dough together into 
                    a large ball. Use a knife to cut the ball in half. Form 
                    into two disks. As you work the dough into disks, it 
                    should end up smooth, having the consistency of Play-Doh. 
                    Don't worry about over-working this dough. Form the disks 
                    so that there are no cracks.</p>
                <p>Sprinkle all over with a little flour. Wrap tightly with 
                    plastic wrap. Once you wrap the dough disk in plastic wrap, 
                    you can massage the dough and the edges with your warm 
                    hands to close any cracks. Chill in the refrigerator 
                    for an hour or up to a day ahead.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <h3>Remove the dough from fridge, let sit, then roll out:</h3>
                </p>
                <p>After the dough has been sitting in the fridge for an 
                    hour, remove it and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes at 
                    room temperature to become more malleable before 
                    rolling out.</p>
                <p>If it still feels too stiff to roll out, hold your 
                    hands around the edges to soften.</p>
                <p>To roll out, sprinkle a clean, flat surface with flour. 
                    As you roll the dough, check to make sure the bottom 
                    is not sticking. If it is, lift it up and sprinkle a 
                    little flour underneath.</p>
                <p>Roll out to 12 to 14 inches wide, to an even thickness.</p>
                <p>Whether you use the dough for a galette or a double 
                    crust pie, it will be prettier with a light egg wash. 
                    Just whisk one egg in a small bowl, add a teaspoon 
                    of water, and brush lightly over the exposed crust 
                    with a pastry brush, right before baking.</p>
