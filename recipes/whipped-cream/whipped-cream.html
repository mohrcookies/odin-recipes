    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This whipped cream recipe has only 4 ingredients in it: 
            Heavy cream, maple syrup, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. 
            No additional flavors, sweeteners, or other difficult-to 
            read ingredients to preserve it.</p>
            <p>Now, the maple whipped cream recipe below makes 2 cups 
                of whipped cream, but if you need less than that feel 
                free to halve the ingredients. The whipping time will 
                not change. Need more? Double it.</p>
            <p>It keeps well in the fridge up to two days as long as 
                it is placed in an airtight container.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><strong>Yield:</strong> 2 cups</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract, or ½ vanilla bean (seeds scraped)</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Attach the whisk attachment to a standing mixer. Alternatively, 
                you can whip it by hand (or with a handheld mixer). If you do 
                so, it might take a few minutes longer.</li>
                <li>Add all the ingredients into the bowl.Whisk in medium-low 
                    speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase the speed to 
                    high and whip until soft peaks form, 1-2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
